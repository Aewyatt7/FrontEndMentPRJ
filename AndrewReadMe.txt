Frontend Mentor Summary Component
This project is about creating a Summary Component for a web page. The goal was to make a summary look nice and work well on different devices.

Project Overview
What I Built: I made a summary that shows how someone did on a test.
How I Made It: I used HTML for the structure and CSS for the looks.

How I Did It
Making the Structure: First, I wrote the code to set up the parts of the summary in HTML.
Making It Look Good: Then, I used CSS to make it look decent. I chose colors that were provided, put things in the right places, and made sure it works on phones and computers.

Things I Learned
Using Different Colors: I learned how to read the playbook that was given to me. I had to research quite a few things to excute correctly

Making It Fit on All Screens: I learned how to make sure the summary looks good on small phones and big computers.
Finding Help Online: I used a website called MDN Web Docs to learn more about CSS and how to do things like picking colors and making things fit on different screens.

Challenges I Faced
Figuring Out Colors: It was hard at first to get the colors right
Making tags that were easy to understand in use in CSS. 

Making It Work on All Devices: Making sure the summary looks good on different screens was tricky.
Understanding CSS: CSS was a bit confusing, but I learned a lot by practicing and reading about it on MDN Web Docs.
